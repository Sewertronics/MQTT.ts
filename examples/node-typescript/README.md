# MQTT.ts Node.js/TypeScript Example

Install first:

```
npm install
```

Subscribe to `#` and log topic and payload:

```
npx ts-node sub.ts
```

Test publish:

```
npx ts-node pub.ts
```

To get TypeScript IntelliSense to work in VS Code, open this folder in its own VS Code window. I think the Deno extension may be causing issues when VS Code has the whole project open.
